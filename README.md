# Movies Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)
**Purpose:** To perform Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) on several movie daatsets to predict popular films for a streaming service <br />
## Overview of the analysis
A world largest platform for streaming movies and TV shows would like to sponsor a Hackathon, providing a clean dataset of movie data for participants to predict the popular pictures. A member will be assisted with creating an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. The project consists of four technical deliverables to create the datasets for teh Hackathon

1. Write an ETL function to read three data files.
2. Extract and Transform the Wikipedia data
3. Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
4. Create the Movie Database4
