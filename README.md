# Movies Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)
**Purpose:** To perform Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) on several movie datasets to predict popular films for a streaming service. <br />
## Overview of the analysis
The world largest platform for streaming movies and TV shows would like to sponsor a Hackathon. They would provide a clean dataset of movies data for participants to predict the popular pictures. A member of the Hackathon organizing committee will be assisted with creating an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. The project's four technical deliverables required to create the datasets for the Hackathon include:

1. Write an ETL function to read three data files.
2. Extract and Transform the Wikipedia data
3. Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
4. Create the Movie database
